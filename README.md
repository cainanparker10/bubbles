This web-based app should allow the user to upload a .csv and automatically download the converted .kml file.

Currently in the to-do:
- HTML, CSS etc. are all good to go
- Automatic download is still not working, need to find out why
- Go to server, and pull this repo down into the correct folder
- Open a new port for web host
- fin.
